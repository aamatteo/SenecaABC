The FGWeather and FGWeatherGui modules are intented to control the outside visual weather shown in FlightGear.
It uses the telnet-interface available in Flightgear.

SETUP
-----

1) Open the telnet port on flightgear, probably you want to do this in the startup script with an extra option:
    --telnet=5401

2) Add FGWeather to your project, on your solo node, and on ONE computer in the simulation.
    For example add in modules.solo and/or modules.srsig1:
    HapticFlightEnvelopeProtectionTestBench/FGWeather HEAD

3) Make a choice:
    a) You want to keep it simple, and want to use the gui.
        Note that the gui also has a field to send raw telnet commands, for example to change time.
        In this case you want to add the FGWeatherGui to modules.solo and/or modules.srsecs:
        HapticFlightEnvelopeProtectionTestBench/FGWeatherGui HEAD
    b) You want to automate some things from somewhere else.
        Now you should write yourself to the FGWeatherInput-channel. So in your module of preference, subscribe to the channel in your comm-objects.lst:
        HapticFlightEnvelopeProtectionTestBench/comm-objects/FGWeatherInput.dco

4) Add the Telnet-interface to all the nodes where FlightGear is running.
    Probably this means modules.srsig1/2/3 or modules.dutmms3
    HapticFlightEnvelopeProtectionTestBench/TelnetInterface HEAD

5) Start changing the dueca.mod file. If you are reading this file, I assume you know how to get a module on a certain node...
    a) In case you want the gui, on your gui node (srsecs, dutmms1, solo) add the following:
          ;; Interface to the FlightGear Weather Module
          ;; Advanced option: If you want to play around with partname, use set-weather-partname or set-telnet-partname.
          (make-module 'fg-weather-gui "" sim-priority
            'set-timing sim-timing
            'check-timing 10000 20000
          )
    b) On one node (probably srsig1/dutmms3_0/solo), add the main weather module:
          ;; Actually make a metar
          ;; Note that this basically is an interface between the metar input and a telnet command
          ;; Advanced option, playing with partnames: set-read-part-name/set-write-part-name
          (make-module 'fg-weather-module "" sim-priority
            'set-timing sim-timing
            'check-timing 10000 20000
          )
    c) On each of the nodes where FlightGear is running:
          ;; Interface to some telnet port, probably FlightGear?
          ;; Keep in mind you adjust the partname (here "center") for each of the difference flightgear nodes
          ;; Also make sure the ip/port is correct, in HMI you probably need to select a different port on dutmms3_1
          ;; Keep the read-partname equal to the one used for the fg-weather-module
          (make-module 'telnet-interface-module "center" sim-priority
            'set-timing         sim-timing
            'check-timing       10000 20000
            'ip                 "127.0.0.1"
            'port               5401
            'set-read-part-name ""
          )

USAGE
-----

If you use the gui, just change the parameters to what you want and click send.

If you are sending the FGWeatherInput-channel, the FGWeather-module triggers on the clock and reads your event. It translates it in a metar/telnet command and sends it to telnet interface.

Note that using telnet does not guarantee any correct timing. It happens quite fast, yet is not instantanious.
Also note that changing the weather in FlightGear itself can sometimes change slowly, so think what you change before wondering why 'it doesn't work (yet)'. ;)
